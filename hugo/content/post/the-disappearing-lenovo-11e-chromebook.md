Where is the yoga 11e Chromebook? It was announced at the beginning of
the year and then promptly disappeared into the abyss. I finally found
this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cr4f7QJKrc&feature=youtu.be).

So the interesting thing for me is that the presenter talks about a
quad core celeron. A WAT? Yup turns out this is a thing. A Bay trail
thing. Bay trail seems to have been a soft launch for Intel due to
unspecified USB issues...

Apparently they were so bad they scrapped the entire launch line up and
released a C0 revision.

Hopefully it's going to launch soon. I really want to see a Chromebook
with an Intel processor and an IPS screen. Google I/O is next month. Maybe
they'll be an announcement there.

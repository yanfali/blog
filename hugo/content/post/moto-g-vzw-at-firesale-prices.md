Picked up a VZW Moto G prepaid handset at Fry's today for <50$US. Makes a
great WiFi only device. It runs Android 4.4.2, so it's possible to disable
all the crapware on the device and leave a very clean app draw. It's a
fairly quick last generation device.

**Cons**: CDMA, 8GB non-expandable storage, locked bootloader, 2.4GHz
wifi. **Pros**: quad core android kitkat device for very little money.

**Updated**: I successfully activated the handset without contacting
VZW. I disabled everything except the apps I wanted and it's now streaming
google music. Much cheaper than any ipod and infinitely more customizable
for my purposes.

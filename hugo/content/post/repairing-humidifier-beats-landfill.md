Motivated by Kazu developing a suspicious cough I finally sat down
to repair his humidifier. The old one had a super cheap sleeve
blower in it which naturally failed after a year or so.

It was a weird voltage 24v blower which was not common for that
small size of blower. I did find a 12v model with ball bearings. I
found some articles about using a zener diode to step down voltages.
I used a 12v diode to cut the volts in half and following the advice
of the article a couple of resistors in series to limit the current
to 170mA.

I proofed of concepted it using an external power supply and some
alligator clips. Fun project. I think it's safe as I used larger
components than necessary.

I'm very proud to [announce](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s28/sh/7ca7e258-b43d-462a-9ebb-1759621cfc6d/77537cbe2a77fa537b5339c00d21743d) that the Calamari project I've been working
on at Inktank has been open sourced. The part I contributed to was the
UI and lives in calamari-clients. Most of the heavy lifting was done
by our awesome backend team, John Spray, Gregory Meno, Dan Mick, Noah
Watkins and the entire Ceph community led by the amazing Sage Weil.

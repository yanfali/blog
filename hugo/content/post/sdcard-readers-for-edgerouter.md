Sdcard readers arrived today! I just swapped them in and buttoned
up the case. These readers are awesome. Plus they handle sdxc! Bonus
points!

The edge router booted perfectly. 17Mb/s reads as advertised. Very
clean install now compared to before. The SLC drive makes a really
good mavericks install stick, do it has found another use already.

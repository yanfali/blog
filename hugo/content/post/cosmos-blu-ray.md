My copy just arrived in the mail today. The production values are
simply phenomenal. I'm contantly blown away by the visualizations and
presentation used to explain such complex knowledge in simple ways. It's
really inspiring.

Tonight I watched Episode 5. There's so much information packed into a 45
minute show I think it bears re-watching a few times to even get half
of it.

The video quality is really amazing. Each episode is 10GiB of 1080p and
DTS Audio. I haven't had a chance to peruse the extras yet, but it looks
like a bunch of documentaries and an interactive Calendar of time is on
the last disc. Kazu should like it.

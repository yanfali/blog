I'm really looking forward to the imminent release of the new Intel
celeron n2930. Quad core and 7.5w tdp. Priced at 150$ in a nuc like form
factor. [Zotac](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s28/sh/511c98f9-c8b8-47db-a8a3-97bb9d8891a0/f53901308ee8ab48f746dc53b73b72fd) has a fanless model in the works which can take up to 8GB
of RAM and a 2.5" Drive.

This would make a really great Intel based cluster node. I'm envisioning
a small 3 or 4 node cluster for experimentation. Geeky, frugal and fun.

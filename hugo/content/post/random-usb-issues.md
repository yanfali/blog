USB seems to be extremely sensitive to transient power problems. I've
been chasing down some extremely annoying bluetooth, camera and headset
issues. Some devices seem to be relatively immune to poor quality 5v,
some devices like cameras, bluetooth and headsets seem sensitive.

It's been a couple of weeks since I installed a Line Conditioner in-front
of my main desktops and I've had zero issues since then. Coincidence?

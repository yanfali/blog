I'm a Software Developer with a penchant for JavaScript, Golang and
Invalidating Warranties. I'm deeply interested in the web and it's
related technologies. I appreciate good design, even if I can't always
make beautiful things.

I'm also a father and husband. Sometime motorcycle enthusiast and player
of *video* games; Oh and I love Iain M. Banks, RIP, but you already
knew that.
